# classicWinGui
Windows 95 style gui tool in SDL

This used to be developement of classicWinGui when its idea was simply Windows 95 looking gui lib, but since idea switched to custom backend translation approach, SDL calls with its structures makes no sense to continue. The developement stopped when trying to implement grid for SDL2 rect/image arrays, and its not planned to continue here. If you however want to continue developing it this way, I'd recommend creating structs for rows and columns, and just insert SDL structs onto proper indexes in them. But that's just a thought, feel free to do anything you want. Anyway, as for me, developement is closed, there is not really much in there and I dont want to continue making classicWinGui in this approach when different suits me much better.
